### Overview of Repository

This repository contains one Jupyter notebook, that details the simulation of data to represent the health status of the Irish population.

The Healthy Ireland Survey was used as a basis for this simulation. This is an annual, large-scale survey of the Irish public, on numerous topics related to health. Participants are sourced from all areas of the Republic of Ireland, and the survey sample is weighted to mirror the age and gender distribution of the population. The survey covers a wide range of topics including physical measurements, alcohol and tobacco consumption, general health, sleep quality and physical activity levels.

For the purposes of this simulation I focused on the following:
- Demographic Factors (age, gender, employment status, affluence level)
- Health Indicators (BMI, physical activity level, tobacco and alcohol usage and sleep quality)

The notebook discusses each of these variables, the relationships between them and simulates a dataset in Python based on these relationships.

### Python Libraries

The following Python libraries were used to develop the dataset:
- Matplotlib/Seaborn
- Pandas
- NumPy Random
- Scipy Stats

The full list of packages used can be found in the requirements.txt file in the repository.
